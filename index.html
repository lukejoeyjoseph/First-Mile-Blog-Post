                    <article class="article-about">
                        <p>How I got to this point in my life where I realized I have a passion for code and what I can do with it, is really quite unique. I worked as a tradesperson for many years in mining located in Western Australia. I had the opportunity
                            to experience many aspects of the maintenance industry and climb the ladder so to speak, entering into leadership and learning business management. I started using a lot of reporting platforms for my work, including some that
                            require a basic level of coding to create visualizations.</p>

                        <p>This led me down the path to coding and developing. I have since built a few websites using the simple platforms like Yola etc. however there is minimal coding required for platforms like that, hence my decision to take on studies
                            in software engineering. I am getting a lot out of this course already and have had many light bulb moments where I have seen code somewhere before but didn't understand it, now I do which is very satisfying. The possibilities
                            are endless working in this industry as this is the way the world is going, which is of benefit to me as i really enjoy this type of work. My thoughts are that to be good at your job is one thing, but to really enjoy your job
                            on top of that is something that many people want but haven't had the opportunity to discover.</p>

                        <p>In a world that is more frequently becoming technologically advanced, I think it's important to keep ourselves updated as much as possible.</p>
